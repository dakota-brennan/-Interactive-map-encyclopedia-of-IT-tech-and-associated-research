OSI APPLICATION LAYER

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Application Layer (L 7)</mark> 

	-nickname
Scribe. APIs, network services

The application layer is used by end-user software such as web browsers and email clients. It provides protocols that allow software to send and receive information and present meaningful data to users. A few examples of application layer protocols are the [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://www.imperva.com/learn/performance/http2/) (HTTP), File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Post Office Protocol (POP), Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and Domain Name System (DNS).

	-FUNCTION
High-level [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API "API"), including resource sharing, remote file access
@ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_protocols

- a set of interfaces for applications to obtain access to networked services
- access to network services that support applications directly
-  application access
- security checking
-  information validation
 
The Application Layer provides the following functions (Tan Ten Hong)3:

·  <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">File Transfer, Access and Management (FTAM)</mark> : Provides handling services in
the network. This includes the movement of files between different systems,
reading, writing and deletion of remote files, and management of remote file
storage.
· <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> Virtual Terminal (VT)</mark> : Provides services to access applications in different
remote computer systems through stimulating a real terminal.
·  <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Electronic Mail and Messaging Handling (MHS)</mark> : Facilitates the electronic
exchange of documents.
· <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> Directory Services (DS)</mark> : Provides services with the ability to match names with
addressing information.
· <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;"> Common management Information Protocol (CMIP)</mark> : Provides services for
network management.

	PROTOCOLS
 "We distinguish two categories of application layer protocols:  user protocols that provide service directly to users, and support protocols that provide common system functions. Requirements for user and support protocols will be found in the companion RFC (INTRO:1)."
 @ RFC 1122

	osi vs tcpip
Distributed applications services, whether OSI or TCP/IP based, have some common
characteristics (Tan Ten Hong)3:
·  An end-user interface that provides a human or another application with the
means to enter commands that direct the application to send files to and receive
files from a remote host, list or change directories, rename or delete files, etc.
·  The means of performing input to and output from mass storage devices.
·  The means of transferring the files and file-related information between hosts.
